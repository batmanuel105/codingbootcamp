# lesson *2* variables

## 1. naming rules

1. you only allowed to use specific charecters in a name:

    * letters upper and lower
    * nubers
    * _ 
    * cannot start with a number
    * use md cheat sheet


    e.g.:

    * `cat`: good
    * `age`: good
    * `score2`: good
    * _`name`_: good
    * `3name`: error
    * `name!`: error

``` python
print(3)
```
2. Self-doccumenting: a name should explain itself. for example `fname` `lname` are beter than `name1` `name2` which are even better than `x` and `y`

3. try to follow a fixed style

`calc_Result`

`result_calculation`

4. when you ahve a long anme, join words with `_`, which is called snake-case

first_score_of_class
